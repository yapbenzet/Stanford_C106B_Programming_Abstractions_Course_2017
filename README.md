Assignment One (Completed Jan/17/2017):
==========================
Problem 1: Removing all occurrences of characters
Write a function CensorString that takes two strings as input and returns
the first string with all of the characters that are present in the second removed.

Problem 2: Files and Structs
When we grade your exams, we’re going to keep track of some statistics like the min,
max and average scores. Define a struct containing these statistics. Then, write a
function that takes a filename, reads the scores from it (one per line where 0 <= score <=
100), and returns the struct you defined. For efficiency’s sake, your function should
make only a single pass over the file

Problem 3: Vectors
Write a function CountLetters that takes a filename and prints the number of times
each letter of the alphabet appears in that file. Because there are 26 numbers to be
printed, CountLetters needs to create a Vector.
